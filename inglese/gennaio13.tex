\s[Questions of Frankenstein]
The novel starts with captain Walton, who was exploring the North Pole (he was searching the northwest passage in particular \t he wanted to find a passage to access the Pacific Ocean) \\
He writes to his sister, about his meeting with Victor \\
Paritcular circumstances of the meeting: Victor was travelling on a sledge and was freezing to death \t Walton saved him \\
It is a cautionary tale because \t Victor starts to tell his story, and the cautionary tale is aimed at Walton \\
Victor in his life was overambitious, by creating artificial life and not respecting the gods \t Victor wanted to teach him lesson, so that Walton would not commit his same mistakes \\
Also the Rhyme of the acient mariner is one \t the mariner stops people and tells his story as a moral lesson \\
Fahter is Alphonse, Caroline is his mother, and has two brothers (Ernest and William), while Elizabeth was adopted by the Frankenstein family \\
Elizabeth was adopted while the family was visiting Lake Como \t here they found a poor family, and among the many siblings she was different \\
Elizabeth was actually born in Milan, but his mother died and his father went to prison because of the Austrians (her parents were indipendetists) \\
Caroline was moved by this story and decided to adopt her

\v

Victor was smart and curious \t this led him to being lonely \t and had only Henry and Elizabeth as friends \\
When he is 15, he saw a thunder \t and got fascinated by this sublime event (also a tree caught fire) \\
His father decided to send him to Ingostandt, where he studies anatomy, phylosophy etc. \t but Victor was not happy and wanted to remain close to his family \\
When Caroline dies, she makes the wish that he and Elizabeth would marry in the future
